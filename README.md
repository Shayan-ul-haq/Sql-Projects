# Sql-Projects
This repository contains production-level SQL job scripts developed to support Power BI reports for billing, payments, aging accounts receivable, rebilling, and operational reporting. The scripts handle data extraction, transformation, validation, and error logging to deliver accurate, analytics-ready datasets. Designed for live and scheduled reporting, these queries enable reliable financial tracking, payment analysis, and business performance monitoring through Power BI dashboards.

The SQL scripts are designed using common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and aggregations to transform raw transactional data into analytics-ready datasets. These datasets are optimized for direct consumption in Power BI, significantly reducing manual reporting effort while improving accuracy and consistency.

Key analyses include monthly revenue trends, order performance metrics, employee utilization insights, and three-month rolling projections based on historical performance. The outputs are structured to support interactive Power BI visuals such as KPI cards, trend charts, and utilization dashboards.

This project demonstrates real-world business intelligence practices, including clean query design, performance-aware SQL development, and seamless integration with Power BI for executive-level reporting and decision support.
